Domain classes can be generated by Grails (in which case Grails will helpfully create a unit test automatically), or you can simply create the file yourself.

[source, bash]
----
$ ./grailsw create-domain-class Vehicle

| Created grails-app/domain/org/grails/guides/Vehicle.groovy
| Created src/test/groovy/org/grails/guides/VehicleSpec.groovy
----

This will generate two Groovy files, one being our domain class, and the other a unit test. Let's see what our domain class looks like.

[source, groovy]
----
package org.grails.guides

class Vehicle {

    static constraints = {
    }
}
----

Right now our domain class has no properties, and no constraints. That's not very interesting, but it's worth noting that this is all that's needed to wire up a persistent domain class in our application. By default, Hibernate will be used to configure a datasource (an in-memory H2 database by default) and create tables and associations for all Groovy classes under `grails-app/domain`. Let's add some properties to this domain class:

[source, groovy]
----
package org.grails.guides

class Vehicle {

    String name //<1>

    String make
    String model

    static constraints = { //<2>
        name maxSize: 255
        make inList: ['Ford', 'Chevrolet', 'Nissan']
        model nullable: true
    }
}
----
<1> Properties will be used to create columns in the database (assuming a relational database is used)
<2> Constraints are used to enforce valid data in each field - Grails provides a rich set of constraints for common scenarios, and you can define custom constraints as well

Please see the Grails documentation for a complete list and documentation of how to use https://docs.grails.org/latest/ref/Domain%20Classes/Usage.html[domain classes] and https://docs.grails.org/latest/ref/Constraints/Usage.html[constraints]
