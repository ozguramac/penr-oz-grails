If you'd like to change the port number, simply edit the `application.yml` file under `grails-app/conf/`, and add the following line:

[source, yml]
----
server:
    port: 8090
----

You can supply the port number directly in the command invocation:

[source, bash]
----
$ ./grailsw run-app --port=8090

| Running application...
Grails application running at http://localhost:8090 in environment: development
----
